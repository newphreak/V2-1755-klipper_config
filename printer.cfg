# This file contains common pin mappings for the BigTreeTech Octopus V1.
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the STM32F446 with a "32KiB bootloader"
# Enable "extra low-level configuration options" and select the "12MHz crystal" as clock reference

# after running "make", copy the generated "klipper/out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the OctoPus with that SD card.
